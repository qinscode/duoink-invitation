Welcome to the Duoink PTE Invitation Code Redemption Tool codebase. This tool automates the process of redeeming multiple invitation codes on the Duoink PTE platform, making it efficient to process batches of codes with minimal manual intervention.

## What is Duoink PTE Invitation Tool?

This tool is designed to help users automate the redemption of invitation codes on the Duoink PTE platform. It handles the entire process from logging in via WeChat QR code to processing multiple invitation codes, while tracking successful redemptions and errors. The program intelligently manages code statuses and provides detailed logging of the redemption process.

## Features

- Automated WeChat QR code login to Duoink platform
- Batch processing of multiple invitation codes (format: XXX-XXX-XXX)
- Intelligent handling of different response scenarios:
  - Successful redemption
  - Invalid codes
  - Already used codes
  - Unknown outcomes
- Automatic tracking of code statuses
- Detailed logging throughout the process
- Respects platform daily usage limits

## Getting Started

This section provides a quick start guide to set up and use the tool.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Google Chrome browser
- A WeChat account for login

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the code
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duoink-invitation-tool.git
   cd duoink-invitation-tool
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install selenium webdriver-manager
   ```

## Usage

### About the Code Files

The tool works with the following files:

- `invitation_code.txt` - **Already provided** with the tool, contains invitation codes in the format of `XXX-XXX-XXX` (e.g., `346-384-193`)
- `used_code.txt` - Automatically created to track successfully redeemed codes
- `error_code.txt` - Automatically created to track invalid codes

Example of invitation codes format in the provided `invitation_code.txt`:
```
346-384-193
421-675-982
518-307-246
```

### Running the Tool

1. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python duoink_invitation_redeemer.py
   ```

2. When prompted, scan the WeChat QR code displayed in the browser window
3. The tool will automatically process all codes after successful login
4. Results will be displayed in the console and saved to appropriate files

### Usage Limitations

**Important:** The Duoink platform has a daily limit of approximately 100 invitation code redemptions per account. Please be aware of this limitation when using the tool:

- Plan to process no more than 100 codes per day
- If you have more codes, consider spreading the process across multiple days
- The tool will track which codes have been used or resulted in errors, so you can safely run it on consecutive days without duplicate processing

Exceeding this limit may result in temporary restrictions on your account or reduced success rates.

## How It Works

The tool follows this process:

1. **Code Management:**
   - Reads all codes from the provided `invitation_code.txt`
   - Filters out already used or errored codes
   - Prepares a list of unused codes to process

2. **Login:**
   - Opens Chrome browser and navigates to Duoink
   - Displays WeChat QR code for authentication
   - Waits for successful scan and login

3. **Code Redemption:**
   - For each unused code:
     - Enters the code in the redemption field
     - Handles confirmation dialogs
     - Processes success/error messages
     - Updates tracking files accordingly

4. **Result Tracking:**
   - Successful codes are added to `used_code.txt`
   - Invalid codes are added to `error_code.txt`
   - Detailed logs are provided in the console

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **QR Code Scan Timeout:** Ensure your WeChat app is ready before starting the script. The program waits 60 seconds for login.
- **Element Not Found Errors:** The script has multiple fallback mechanisms to find elements. If errors persist, check if the Duoink website interface has changed.
- **Chrome Driver Issues:** The tool uses webdriver-manager to automatically download the appropriate Chrome driver. Ensure your Chrome browser is up-to-date.
- **Daily Limit Reached:** If redemption success rate suddenly drops after processing many codes, you may have reached the daily limit of ~100 codes. Wait until the next day to continue.
